# Pen-n-paper
A pen-and-paper-like colorscheme for Vim and Neovim.

## Acknowledgements

[@abrsvn](https://github.com/abrsvn) made this colorscheme, I just turned it into a plugin and am distributing it. He said it to looks like "Blue ink on paper" and thats why he loves it so much, so I named it Pen-n-Paper

## How To Use

first, add this colorscheme as a plugin. For instance, with vim-plug it would be: ```Plug Norok-The-Diablo/Pen-n-Paper```. Then, set this as your colorscheme with: ```colorscheme pennpaper```.
